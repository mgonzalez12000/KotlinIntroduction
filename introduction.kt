    VARIABLES
    --------
    - Unlike other strictly written languages, when declaring variables in Kotlin you do NOT need to declare the type for the variable.
    - When declaring variables, Kotlin uses two ways to declare variables: var AND val:
            Use val for a variable that is immutable (never changes)
            Use var for a variable that is mutable (value can change)
      This concept is SIMILAR to JS variable declaration.

     println(name)
     println(birthYear)
     // If you insist to declare the variable type, you can do the following syntax:
     var name2: String = "John2"
     val birthYear2: Int = 1975
     println(name2)
     println(birthYear2)
